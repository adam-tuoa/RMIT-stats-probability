Applied Analytics - generating synthetic data, exploring probability distribution and testing

A data science report made in RStudio, addressing a number of scenario-based problems involving statistical methods and theories.

It was a good learning experience. By now, I've been working with R for the past 4 months and feeling more comfortable and enjoying the ecosystem that RStudio connects with.

Having already learnt something of data wrangling and visualisation using R in two other subjects, I've taken some of those learnings, such as about tidy data principles, functions and visual concepts applied through ggplot, and been able to focus them to help deal with the statistical theory side of things around distributions, comparing means and looking at concepts such as power and effect.
